  "content": "It has been around a month since I have been living in Jaisalmer. The air and water is clean, kids are playing in the streets, few more cafes has opened up but no major changes. The people are satisfied with what they are earning, daily gossips keeps them entertained. The people in the city on the contrary finds new things to keep them entertained either those are related to studies, religion, social work etc etc. \n\nAll the activity of man throughout the centuries has been to achieve a particular result. The result can take several forms either by collecting money, fame, respect, power, position or any other form of entertainment but the mind divides the results into higher and lower column. If a child is studying for an exam we say how bright the kid is and when he is playing with this friends for entertainment, we say this kid is not doing things the right way. The brain has been conditioned throughout centuries to think in terms of time. Sacrifice the present to have a better future has always been the banner of a righteous society. Hardwork is essential for mankind to evolve in technology, science, medicine but to engaging yourself with time that is to keep living in future is to invite endless sorrow. \n\nOne wonders when was the last time we have done some thing in which we expected nothing. Nothing means no result neither the higher nor lower. One meditates to gain the silence in the brain, in this case itself activity of though and time is present as one is constantly seeking result in some kind.\n\nSo I ask myself, can i live totally in the present without any kind of effort, without making my mind dumb by constant suppression, without expecting any result. Only then the mind can have space and silence and in that silence the brain recharges itself. ",
